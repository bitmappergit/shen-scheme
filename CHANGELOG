0.3

	* Improved performance and compatibility. Cleanup some dead code. Fixes

	* Overrides are now done after loading the file that defines that function. This
	improves load time and memory usage by using the improved versions when still
	loading Shen.

	* Added new overrides (macroexpand, shen-walk, hash, shen-digit-byte?,
	shen-byte->digit, symbol?, not, shen-segvar?, shen-grammar_symbol?.

	* Better '=' function, with fast-path for references that are 'eq?' and vector
	compare without converting vectors to lists first.

	* Removed safe symbol conversions, with a custom reader they are not needed.

	* A much improved method of symbol->function resolution which uses a hash table
	instead of `eval`.

	* Fix default fill value for absvectors (was 'fail!' when it should have been
	'shen-fail!')

	* Inline compares to '(fail)'.
